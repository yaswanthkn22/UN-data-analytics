>## Problems


<br>
1: India population over years - Bar Plot
Make a Bar Plot of 'population of India' vs. years.

2: For the year 2014. Bar Chart of population of ASEAN countries
ASEAN is a collection of South East Asian countries. Plot a Bar Chat of the population of these countries. Only use data for the year 2014

3: Over the years, TOTAL population of SAARC countries
In this case for each year you have to calculate the sum of the population of all SAARC countries. Then plot a BAR CHART of Total SAARC population vs. year.

4: In grouped bar charts we can group together may related bar of a single value of the x-axis. You have to plot population of ASEAN countries as groups over the years 2004 - 2014.
